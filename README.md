# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib
## Overview of the analysis
V. Isualize has given me and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
We can observe that:
- Even though Rural cities has the least amount of totals, the Average Fare that it shows are the highest of the three types of cities.
- While Urban cities type shows the most amounts of drivers, rides and fares, they represent the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.

## Summary

- Rural areas lead the fare amounts, maybe because less workers that come to these places, besides que time and the distance is longer that going to suburban or urban places
